## Problem 1

read and tidy the dataset

``` r
homicide_df = read_csv("data/homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city,state,sep = '_'),
         resolved = case_when(
           disposition == 'Closed without arrest' ~ "unsolved",
           disposition == 'Open/No arrest' ~ "unsolved",
           disposition == 'Closed by arrest' ~ "solved",
         )) %>%
  select(city_state,resolved) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL") 
```

summarize

``` r
aggregate_df = homicide_df %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarize(hom_total = n(),
            hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved"))
```

obtain results of proportion tests

``` r
results_df = aggregate_df %>%
  mutate(prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
         tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))) %>%
  select(-prop_tests) %>%
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>%
  select(city_state,estimate,conf.low,conf.high)
```

make plot

``` r
results_df %>%
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state,estimate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 0.1))
```
